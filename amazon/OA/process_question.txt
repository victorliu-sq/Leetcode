Amazon Web Services (AWS) has several processors for executing proces
scheduled on its servers.

There are n processes to be executed, where the jh process takes
execution i] amount of time to execute. Two processes are cohesive if and
only if their original execution times are equal. When a process with
execution time erection tin exercises, sitates"heruaionasemero"SUmal.
and simultaneously reduces the execution time of all its cohesive processe
to ceil(executionli] / 2).

Given the execution time of n processes, find the total amount of time the
processor takes to execute all the processes if you execute the processes in
the given order, i.e. from left to right.
Notes

The ceill() function returns the smallest integer that is bigger or equal to its
argument. For example, ceil(1.1) = 2, ceil(2.5) = 3, ceil(5) = 5, etc.
If the execution time of some process is reduced and becomes equal to the
execution time of any other process ;, then the two
processes /and jare not considered cohesive.

Example
The number of processes is n=6, and their execution times are execution =
[5, 5, 3, 6, 5, 3].
Their execution can be visualized as follows where each set of cohesive
processes is marked with a different color.
Note that in the second row, all of the execution times that were initially 5
were reduced to ceil(5/2).= 3 because they matched the amount of time to
execute the first process. They are cohesive. Even though their values now
equal those at original indices 3 and 6, they did not match originally. They
still are not cohesive. The answer is 21.

for each time:
	for time on the right:
