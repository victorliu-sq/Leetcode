# Basics

## a)        Tell me about yourself

I am Jiaxin Liu who is a graduate student from Brown CS. I will graduate next May. My concentration is system programming including database system, distribtued storage system. And I am solid in C/C++/Go/Python. I learn fundamentals of computer system in Brown univeristy and strengthen my programming skills with tasks in MIT 6.824 and CMU 15-445, namely developing a fault-tolerance sharded kv-store system and a relational database with extensible hashtable and pessimistic concurrency control. I have great interest in finding job related to that field because I want to learn more knowledge in industry world.

## b)        Why this company / Why this position / this team

Amazon is a globally large company that has countless users to query and write data in amazon's database. it is impressive to keep such a large need. Besides, AWS is one of the most famous cloud storage system in the world. Hundreds of thousands of talented engineers work together to build up this amazing tech company. It will be my honor and fortune to work in Amazon. I can learn lots of knowledge about realistic storage system in addition to concepts in textbook I study in school.



## c)        Why leave your last position

## d)        Walk me through your typical day at work.





# Manager or youself or insufficient information

except the situation that the problem is so easy that I can solve it in 5 minutes,

I will respect my manager. If he is absent, I will wait until he/her come back. Because manager will assign tasks according to global situations, it is likely that I will bother other situations if I assign a new function or delete some functions w / o  requesting the manager. That will be a disaster.

 For example,  



# Failure

I fail to find my internship

too much time on Leetcode

no projects and interest

I focus on more basics of CS and recite knowledge -> I ML, fundamentals of computer system, distributed system, storage system. 

now I have great interest in studying database and writing code about back-end

My dream is to support a whole storage system of a big company by myself  in my 30

## a)        Tell me a time when you failed on something

## b)        Tell me a time when you made a mistake

# Success

fault-tolerance sharded system -> shard part

write in go, 

hard part is no reference like paper, and  we need to assure its speed

how to cover, comeInShards and comeOutShards

## a)        Tell me a time when you succeed / a project you proud of

## b)        Tell me a time when you exceed the expectation

## c)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then succeed

## e)        Tell me a time when you had to go behind your manager's back to do something



# Pressure / Challenge

I have ever met one deadline in my shcool life though it does not influence my grade at last.

In Brown, students can choose course as they wish w/o strict prerequisites. When I go to OS course in Brown University at first, I did not learn anything about concurrency control, thread and process and etc. But OS course assumes that all students have studied those stuff. OS is quite hard and the first task is to implement a pthread that can simulate whole cycle of threads. I try my best to study concepts in a whole week but still get confused and can hardly make progess in OS course. At last, I missed the ddl and had to choose another course. 

The hardest part in this project is to switch states of a thread including zombie state, no state, runnable state, running state, blocked state. We need to schedule when a thread can kill, block another.

I drop the course immediately and decide to study it again after reviewing the fundamentals of computer system. I believe I made the right decision because it is quite relaxing to study OS after find lots of knowledge in that introduction course. So I can study better next time.

This tells me that I cannot skip knowledge to study something in advance. I can only make progress step by step.

In fact, when I study database or distributed, I focus a lot in how to make a logical deduction from one concept to another. So I can remember more basic knowledge, which is helpful in study advanced course



Now assume I am in amazon, I get mission from manager and I cannot finished my task on time.

I will talk to my manager directly and tell him the situaion where I am in. 

If he tells me that it's ok to leave some defects in my project, I will submit the project on time by cutting some demands

Or if the project cannot be cut, I will ask for longer time to finish.

In summary, I will respect the commands of my manager at first.

## a)        Tell me a time when you handle difficult customer / task

## b)        Tell me a time when you were forced to do something you are not familiar with

## e)        Tell me a time when you overcame a challenge

## f)        Tell me a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision

## d)        Tell me about a time you were dissatisfied in your work. What could have been done to make it better?

## e)        Tell me a time when you improved a process

## f)        Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.

公司/team现在面临的最大的挑战是什么？how do you expect this role to help the team deal with the challenge？（可以了解这个职位具体要干嘛，他们对你的期待）

你觉得这个position最需要的三个skills是什么？（真的没啥问题问了拿来尬聊一下）

组里用的tool是什么？（可以具体到数据库用哪家，Python跟R哪个更常用等等）

组里有谁跟我要做的工作差不多？ta的typical day是怎样的？

team culture是什么样的？（表现你对这个team真的很感兴趣）

这个职位有travel吗？（真的是没问题问了才会问这个，不过那种一看就不出差的就别问了）

我刚才发现公司真的好多人，如果我现在走出去，跑去问100个人“why xxx（公司名）”，你觉得他们回答的交集是什么？（我最喜欢问这个问题，了解员工在这里工作的motivation）

这是我一般会问得比较多的问题，还有一种问法，就是把他们问我的问题还回去，比如：
what motivated you to join the company and what do you enjoy most working here? (让面试官回答why xxx这个问题). ----
how do you see your team in the next 3/5/10 years？（问team的leader比较合适）
